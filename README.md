# extract_functions
A function to extract from long running R scripts

Currently, this is just a script. Perhaps I find the time to wrap it into an R 
package later. 

Feel free to raise any issues or pull requests. 

## TODOs

 - [ ] Include inicator where to find corrupt functions (in append_to_extracts())
